* `300 g` frozen strawberries
* `50 g` vanilla yogurt
* `50-100 ml` water
* `40 g` sugar

> Add into a bowl and blend using an immersion blender – a proper blender probably works quicker, but I haven't got one – until smooth. If it's too thick to efficiently blend, add a bit more water. Fill into glases and enjoy.
